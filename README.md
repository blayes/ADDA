* Organization
  - There are for directories that correspond to a subsection in the experiments section of the paper: blasso (Bayesian lasso), lme (linear mixed-effects model), logistic (logistic regression), and movie_lens (real data analysis using logistic regression and linear mixed-effects model).
  - Each directory has two sub directories: code, qsub.
  - Directory 'code' has files of all the R source code that was used in the analysis. 
  - Directory 'qsub' has SGE files (.q) that were used to submit jobs on a SGE cluster. 

* Citation
  If you use the code, then please cite the following paper:

* Contact
  Please email Sanvesh Srivastava (<sanvesh-srivastava@uiowa.edu>) if you have any questions related to the code.

* Acknowledgment
  - Some code for MovieLens data analysis has been borrowed from Patrick O. Perry (<http://ptrckprry.com/code/>).
